## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:

### **Research on Multimodal Lithology Classification Using Remote Sensing and Geographic Priors**  
*Independent Research | Oct. 2023 - Jul. 2024*

The task of lithology classification is challenging due to the abstraction of multiple attributes. To enhance the accuracy of lithology classification, I proposed a Multimodal Lithology Remote Sensing Scene Classification Model with Multi-scale Geographic Semantic Priors (MGS-Net). This model integrates multi-source remote sensing data, lithology spatial distribution data, and large language model word embedding data for high-precision classification.

- **Innovations:**
  1. Proposed a lithology remote sensing classification model based on geographic priors and multimodal learning.
  2. Developed a pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal remote sensing lithology classification tasks.
  
- **Achievements:**
  1. A research paper titled "Multimodal Lithology Remote Sensing Scene Classification with Multi-scale Geographic Semantic Priors" presented orally and ready for submission.
  2. Awarded **2024 Outstanding Bachelor Thesis** at China University of Geosciences (93/100 points, Top 4/108 students).

### **Research on Improving Hyperspectral Image Classification with Deep Learning Models and Vision Transformers**  
*Independent Research | Oct. 2022 - Oct. 2023*

I proposed a deep learning model based on the Vision Transformer to tackle the challenges of large hyperspectral image data volume and low classification accuracy. The study is ready for submission to a Q1 top-tier journal (IJAEOG).

- **Innovations:**
  1. Proposed a Random Masking and Window Encoding-based Spectral-Spatial Transformer network (SST-Net) for HSI classification.
  2. Improved classification accuracy significantly compared to other models.
  
- **Achievements:**
  1. Organized into 2 published patents and 1 conference paper accepted at [IJCNN 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00964).
  2. Presented at the [2nd International Symposium on Advanced Remote Sensing](https://rsw2023.aconf.org/programme.html).
  3. University Student Innovation Program - Outstanding Completion Award.

*Core Member | Feb. 2022 - Apr. 2022*

Focused on improving the accuracy of pest detection under conditions of limited sample data and imbalanced distributions, resulting in a 20% improvement in detection accuracy, earning third prize at the national level.

- **Innovations:**
  1. Applied data augmentation strategies like Mosaic and Cut-and-Paste.
  2. Implemented class weighting and CBAM in YOLO v5 for better small-target detection.
